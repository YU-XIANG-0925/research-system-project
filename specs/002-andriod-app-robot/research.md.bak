# Phase 0: Research & Discovery

**Objective**: Analyze the feature specification to identify unknowns, risks, and external dependencies. This phase focuses on clarifying the 'what' and 'why' before planning the 'how'.

**Input**: `specs/002-andriod-app-robot/spec.md`

## 1. Requirement Analysis

- **FR-001**: Main page for function selection.
- **FR-002**: Connection page for MQTT broker.
- **FR-003**: Persistent MQTT connection.
- **FR-004**: "Play Robot Action" page with a list of actions.
- **FR-005**: Publish motor angles at 1 Hz on the "Play Robot Action" page.
- **FR-006**: "Manual Robot Adjustment" page.
- **FR-007**: Initialize motor angles to zero on the "Manual Robot Adjustment" page.
- **FR-008**: Display motor angles at 1 Hz on the "Manual Robot Adjustment" page.
- **FR-009**: "Record" button to publish motor angles.
- **FR-010**: "Return" button to reset motor angles to zero.
- **FR-011**: Project in `@robot` directory.
- **FR-012**: Android-based solution.

## 2. Disambiguation (Questions for Stakeholders)

- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** What is the expected format of the motor angle data published to MQTT?
- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** How should the app handle the case where the robot does not respond to commands?
- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]** What are the specific details of the "official, pre-defined robot actions"?

## 3. Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Ensuring a stable and persistent MQTT connection across different app functions.
- **Medium Risk**: Real-time data synchronization and display (1 Hz updates).
- **Low Risk**: UI layout and navigation.

## 4. External Dependencies

- **NuwaSDKExample**: The project must strictly follow the structure and implementation of this sample project.
- **MQTT Library**: A Java-based MQTT client library is required.
- **Robot SDK**: The proprietary SDK located in the `tools` directory.
